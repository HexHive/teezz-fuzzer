## TEEzz

This is the main repository for our work [TEEzz: Fuzzing Trusted Applications on COTS Android Devices](http://hexhive.epfl.ch/publications/files/23Oakland.pdf).
TEEzz is a black-box fuzzer for trusted applications running on COTS Android mobile devices.

We are still in the process of making TEEzz ready for use by other researchers and are planning to
finish our work by the end of July 2023. Up until this date, we will successively add artifacts and documentation. 

The source code of TEEzz is distributed across multiple repositories loosely reflecting the four phases of TEEzz's pipeline.

* [Client Application Identification](https://github.com/HexHive/teezz-caid) (work in progress)
* [Client Application Drivers](https://github.com/HexHive/teezz-ca-driver) (work in progress)
* [AST Processing (Mutators and Recorders)](https://github.com/HexHive/teezz-introspection.git) (work in progress)
* [Fuzzing Engine](https://github.com/HexHive/teezz-fuzzing-engine.git) (work in progress)
